	/*
	 *- Groups related classes.
	 *- Allows us to deal with more then one class with the same name.
	 *- Import allows us to use there packages  
	 *- Packages allows us to define a new package.
	 *- Qualify classes with the packages it comes with "java.util.ArrayList"
	 *- Using  asterisk for a hole package class it doesn't make out code a lot big in size because
	 *	it imports everything, it doesn't affect what is available to us it affect what we have to type 
	 *	to be clear to what we where referring to. 
	 * - Package name Example :"com.dridichaith.Module","com.dridichaith.ejb"
	 * - in the file explorer it will be Example "com>dridichaith>Module" ,"com>dridichaith>ejb"
	 * - if you have two classes with the same name they need to be in seperate packages
	 * - Default packages called unnamed packages.
